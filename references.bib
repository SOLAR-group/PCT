abstract = {Transplantation is a procedure in which cells, tissues, or organs of an individual are replaced by those of another individual or the same person. This procedure has saved the lives of many people since its implementation in medicine. Patients with end-stage organ failure and certain autoimmune diseases or malignancies that would have died otherwise have extended lives, and in some cases, been cured. However, complications such as infection, graft rejection, and graft failure have long existed that affected the lives of the patients following transplantation. Immunosuppressive methods and certain pre-transplant and post-transplant measures have been undertaken and have been successful to improve the quality of life and survival rates of the patients. However, they are still being developed to reach optimal results. The demand for organ transplantation is on the rise, and this leads to extended waiting lists. This issue has affected the criteria for organ transplantation and continues to do so to increase patients’ overall survival rates.}

abstract="Increasingly, high-assurance applications rely on dynamically adaptive systems (DASs) to respond to environmental changes, while satisfying functional requirements and non-functional preferences. Examples include critical infrastructure protection and transportation systems. A DAS comprises a collection of (non-adaptive) target systems (represented as UML models) and a set of adaptations that realize transitions among target systems. Two sources of uncertainty inherent to DASs are: (1) predicting the future execution environment, and (2) using functional and non-functional trade-offs to respond to the changing environment. To address this uncertainty, we are inspired by living organisms that are astonishingly adept at adapting to changing environmental conditions using evolution. In this paper, we describe a digital evolution-based approach to generating models that represent possible target systems suitable for different environmental conditions, enabling the developer to identify the functional and non-functional trade-offs between the models, and then assisting the developer in selecting target systems for the DAS.",
